# Intro to my CodePen Page for CSS and HTML

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aanwar5/pen/WNwENvb](https://codepen.io/aanwar5/pen/WNwENvb).

This is basically my first ever page which I've made for my Freecodecamp certificate. This is a tribute page to Dr.Norman Barlough! I did take a few samples from the sample website however I did it with understanding.
